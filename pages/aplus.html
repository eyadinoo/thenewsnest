            <h4>March 25, 2023</h4>
            <img src="../img/aplus.jpg" alt="an A+ written on lined paper">

            <p><strong>A miracle occurred </strong> when Eyad, waking up 20 minutes after his class had already started,
                discovered on Microsoft Teams that his website project had actually earned him an A plus. A grade unprecedented
                in his academic career, Eyad found himself for the first time scoring above a C minus on something he put effort into.
                "I really don't see why it's such a big deal," Eyad said when asked for comments. "I just added something
                here and there, a little pizazz, if you will, it's nothing special. I did it like I always do - perfectly."
            </p>

            <p id="last-paragraph">"It's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life," commented Eyad's programming instructor, Pannun. "This is the kind of 
                thing that makes teachers resign. Have you seen this website? Really? I could code a better website with no fingers, on my Samsung Smart Fridge. 
                How is this even news? Are you guys with Make-A-Wish?" Pannun refused any further questions.
